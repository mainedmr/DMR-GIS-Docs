## Welcome

This survey has been created to gather feedback from commercial and recreational fishermen on how and where fishing activities occurs relative to proposed wind development areas.

It is recommended that this survey be completed on a desktop computer (vs a mobile device) in browsers Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

We estimate this survey will take 10-15 minutes to complete. The survey includes 8 sections, including this page. In each section, you will be asked for feedback on the following:

1. `About` - current section
2. `Contact Information` - your name, phone number, optionally email address, and the licenses held.
3. `Distance From Shore` - you will be asked to fill in a table with the percentage of your fishing effort per quarter across several distance from shore bands. A map will be provided to aid in answering this question.
4. `Areas Fished Quarterly` - this section will request that you select the 10 arc-minute square that contains the greatest amount of your fishing activity for each quarter of the year. A map will be shown such that you can click each square in order throughout the year.
5. `17-34NM Areas Fished` - if your responses to the previous sections indicate you fish in the 17-34NM from shore band, this section will request that you choose all 10 arc-minute grids in this distance range and enter the percentage of your total yearly fishing effort that occurs in each square.
6. `Depths Fished` - this question will ask you to proportion your quarterly fishing effort by depth, similar to the `Distance from Shore` section.
7. `Bottom Types Fished` - identical to `Depths Fished` but by bottom type.
8. `Questions/Concerns and Submission` - the final section allows you to enter any questions and/or concerns you have about wind development, and then submit your survey responses.
